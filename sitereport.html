 		<div class="exp">Experience</div>
 		<p class="txt">I was interested in coding from a small age and I found this more interesting. I've tried to apply as many codes as I can apply. These are some different pages where various designs are applied to make a page. I've learnt many things from this assignment. Now, I have learnt to use these codes very clearly. I think if I can  use these codes daily then it may help me for further upcoming complex codes/languages.</p>
 		<p class="txt">Talking about my experience while doing this assignment from the very beginning it was very hard for me to understand the assignment. I was confused about what needs to be done and what must not be done. There were a lot of problems while creating the website. I didn’t have any clear concept about the way I wanted to design the site. The coding was difficult as I didn’t know how to use them correctly. The page was not what I expected it to be. The photo would either overlap or not stay in the desired location . While creating the website I learned a lot about the problems that may occur in the process of building a website such as margin problems, padding and choosing the wrong display . Making the hamburger icon work didn’t go as planned because the menu it was supposed to show didn’t work. As I solved a problem another would arise making it difficult to maintain balance. </p>

		<p class="txt">There arose a lot of problems while putting together the website but it helped me with learning more about the things we were taught in class. I gained an understanding of using comments while coding. I also learned how to use Github and repositories throughout this process. I got the hang of using specific tags and how they differ in response to the code assembled.
